/*difference between interface and class
 * interface:
 * 1) they are 100% incomplete.
 * 2) they support multiple inheritance.
 * abstract class:
 * 1) they can be 0-100 % incomplete.
 * 2) they do-not support multiple inheritance.

/*
 * what is abstraction?
 * Answer - hiding of implementation details is called as abstraction, the
 * way we achieve that in java is using interfaces and abstract 
 * class concept.
 * 
 * Note: data hiding: making var private.
